    question:
      "What’s the difference between a Pro and a Pro for Teams account?",
    answer:
      "A MyPdf Pro account gives you personal access to all of our Pro features—from strong compression to OCR. You also get unlimited access to all 30+ MyPdf tools, including our suite of AI-powered tools. Our MyPdf Pro for Teams account provides the same unlimited access to all tools and Pro features, with discounted pricing for teams. You also get priority support, simpler billing options, and more. If you’ve got a team of two or more—from small group projects, to company departments or your entire organization—Teams is the way to go.",
